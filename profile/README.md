Most volunteers do not have their own resource for quick and high-quality management of incoming applications and tracking the status of their implementation.

We noticed that many people process this information using Google Tables, which is not very convenient.

That is why The Dragon Code team decided to develop their own CRM for volunteers to solve problems with processing applications.

### What do you get?

- Support for working with social networks Telegram and VK (the list is not final and it is possible to expand the coverage of social networks);

### What do we get?
