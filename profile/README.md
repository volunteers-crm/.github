> We are just starting work on this project ðŸ™‚

Most volunteers do not have their own resource for quick and high-quality management of incoming applications and tracking the status of their implementation.

We noticed that many people process this information using Google Tables, which is not very convenient.

That is why [The Dragon Code](https://github.com/TheDragonCode) team decided to develop their own CRM for volunteers to solve problems with processing applications.

### What do you get?

- Free CRM for your volunteer activities;
- Support for working with social networks Telegram and VK (the list is not final and it is possible to expand the coverage of social networks);
- Ready-made web interface for managing your applications.

### What do we get?

- Experience in developing CRM for volunteers.

### How much is it?

- The use of volunteer CRM is absolutely free and we will place it on our servers.
